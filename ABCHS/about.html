    <h3>AATAN BAPTIST COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL, KOSO, OYO</h3><br>
    <h3>HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL</h3>
    <p>Aatan Baptist Church, Koso Oyo was at it again after two attempts of having a post primary school of her own. The first was the Secondary Modern School aborted by the government policy of scrapping secondary schools while the second was the conceding to Isale Oyo Community, a secondary school approved for the church simply to comply with the government policy of non approval of secondary schools for religious bodies. Both battles were lost gallantly at the approval stages of the two schools.</p>

    <p>The church members were never daunted rather they indomitably insisted even religiously that the church should own her own post primary institution at all cost. So at an executive meeting of the church in 1993 under the chairmanship of Rev. Timothy Adedokun Akande, pastor of the church, the issue of establishing a post primary institution was raised. The committee unanimously adopted the proposal and Deacon J. O. Oyedele was assigned to work on the project.</p>

    <p>In 1994, the procedure to establish the school was commenced under the diligent monitoring and pursuance of Deacon J. O. Oyedele L. A. Ajayi both at the local and State Ministry of Education. Our request could not be acceded to in 1994 as two other secondary schools, Nesto College and the College of Education Special Staff School Sped International) Oyo were been considered for approval. But with the assistance of Mr. Okunlola from Ilora, the Director of Schools at the Ministry of Education, Ibadan, our proposed school was inspected by a team from the Ministry of Education led personally by the Hon. Commissioner of Education Dr. (Mrs) Mubo Laoye. The school was approved in 1995 by the ministry of Education, Ibadan as AATAN BAPTIST COMPREHENSIVE HIGH SCHOOL, KOSO, OYO.</p>

    <p>The school took off in November 1995 in the block of four classrooms initially meant for the unapproved Secondary Modern School which was used by Isale Oyo Community Grammar School before moving to it’s permanent site at Oke-Oroki.</p>

    <p>The school began with a gradually increasing enrolment of 54 students under the pioneering principal of Mr. O. A. Adeyi. Who steered the ship of the school successfully between November 1995 and December 2005.</p>

    <p>To God be the Glory, the school was financially independent of the church right from its inception. The school was however supplied with a number of take-off furniture by the church which were later returned to the church primary school when the suitable ones were provided for the students by the school itself. The school bears up to date all its financial responsibilities including payment of staff remunerations funding of various school projects and rendering its various financial responsibilities to the church without fail.</p>

    <p>The church eventually has achieved her primary objective of possessing a post primary institution of her own after a long tortuous battles of insistence, determination and pricely pursuit resulting in the incubation of moral values and religious dignity in the teaching and learning processes of the institution.</p>

    <p>The school started with four permanent staffs and some off-and-on part time teachers who served the school gratis. The pioneer teachers were Messrs A. O. Adeyi, I. A. Ayankoso(late) , Peter Omoniyi, and Simeon A. Oyelayo, while the notable among the part time teachers were Messrs J. A. Oke, Ohu, A. Ayoola (late) and Dn. (Dr.) J. A. Ayelaagbe (late). The members of the non teaching staff were Messrs Dotun Oyeyode (bursar), Mrs. Sayo Faronbi (Typist), Mr. J. Oladejo Akanni (day watch) and Lasisi Oloya (night guard). The school curriculum. Below is the role call of principals and vice principals of the school, past and present.</p>
